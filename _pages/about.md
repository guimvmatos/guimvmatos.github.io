I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), Brazil, and a member of the Laboratory of Studies in Networks, Innovation, and Software Group (LERIS). My research focuses on heterogeneous and disaggregated computing environments, cloud and edge computing, and emerging applications such as AR/VR. I have also worked on topics related to programmable data planes, P4, and network monitoring, with a strong interest in profiling techniques and the optimization of disaggregated data center environments.

I am a researcher in the "SMARTNESS 2030: SMART Networks and Services for 2030" project in collaboration with Ericsson. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I gained significant professional experience as an infrastructure and information security analyst and later as an IT manager, working on complex systems and their security.
