abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2024 ACM CoNEXT Student Workshop. This year's workshop continues its tradition of being an exciting forum for the presentation of early-stage student research results in the field of networking and distributed systems. The mission of the workshop is to share novel ideas and expose students to a conference environment, where they can gain valuable feedback on their research. The CoNEXT Student Workshop gives student researchers a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with both junior and senior members of the community.The call for papers this year attracted submissions from Asia, North America, Europe, and South America. In total, 15 submissions were received, of which 14 were selected for publication after a rigorous review process. Putting together the ACM CoNEXT Student Workshop was a team effort. We first thank the authors for providing the content of the program. We are also grateful to the 29 program committee members, who worked diligently in reviewing papers and providing feedback for student authors.},
